# Unity_FPS_SchoolProject
A project done for school using the Unity game engine. It also uses the microFPS tutorial.

For #1 I went ahead and did the tutorials to start the microfps. I placed the altar on the little plot of floor that looks like it was meant to go. 
For #2 
A.	I added onto the first and second level that were given. I add different platforms, rooms and enemies to those levels. I added a third level completely from scratch. 
B.	Each level has around 5 rooms, and has atleast 20 enemies.
C.	On the 3rd level I not only tried to make the 1st floor look like the lower level of main hall at Kent State Stark, but I also put some posters up in what used to be the art gallery room on that level.
D.	I used some free community assets for the floor tiles. I also created some of my own colors for some of the doors and windows.
E.	On the 2nd level I added some lights to the lower floor. They were spotlights shining down on the floor.
For #3 I added a hard mode by making the enemies hit weapon damage higher, and made their health higher. To the intro scene I added an extra button that takes you to the harder levels. The levels are designed the same, except the changes I already mentioned.
For #4 I didn’t really need to write any extra code. I just used the tools and prefabs that were already given. 
For #5 I am really proud of the 3rd level I made from scratch. It turned out really well. I also added a couple of “final Bosses” at the end of level 3. The bosses are just bigger, stronger versions of the other enemies. I also added a partially transparent elevator door that hide some pickups. I took the collider off so the player can just walk through it if they notice the pickup.
In order to play open the folder, go to builds and use the New_Unity_Project.exe icon.
